          Life is like a cup of coffee is an inspirational short story of a university professor and his students, who gather at 
          professor’s home after a long time. This is a classical example of how can we have a different perspective about life. 
          The short story communicates a very powerful message that the true meaning of life is not the materialistic achievements,
           but going that extra mile in the journey of life which enlighten you the real purpose of it. A must read for everyone, 
           specially the middle age group.
           Nail on the fence is a short story of a father and his arrogant son. In this story; father communicates the lessons on
            anger management very powerfully. This is an old motivational short story and one of my favorite. The story motivates 
             to bring a change in your personality trait which will make a noticeable impact on your relationships and interpersonal
              skills.  A perfect short inspirational story to share with your kids and make them understand how anger can ruin their life.
